## Graduate students

Graduate school should be a rewarding experience, but it can be incredibly challenging at times. The resources provided here are meant to help you transition to a new phase in your life and get the most out of your time at the [UW](https://www.washington.edu/) [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/).

As a new graduate student in our lab, you will be welcomed into a group of diverse individuals with varying interests. We support each other in our respective endeavors and celebrate our successes. You will have numerous opportunities to contribute to our research projects, develop lasting bonds to others within and outside the lab, and help us improve upon our ways.

## Post-docs

Post-docs in our lab conduct independent research and serve as ad hoc advisors to undergraduate and graduate students. They are a useful source of information and can help students navigate difficult situations.
